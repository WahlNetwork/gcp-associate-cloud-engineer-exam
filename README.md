# ðŸ“š Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer Study Materials

This repository contains a mind map that was generated while preparing for the [Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-engineer). It is meant to serve as a reference for the objectives outlined in the exam. However, mind maps are usually most helpful when created by the individual. I suggest using this mind map as a starting point for your own high level mind map to reinforce your learning style. Additionally, hands on experience through real world applications and lab scenarios (e.g. Qwiklabs) are essential.

There are two methods to view the mind map:

1. **[GCP Mind Map (PDF)](gcp_mind_map.pdf)**
2. **[GCP Mind Map Outline (Markdown)](gcp_mind_map_outline.md)**
